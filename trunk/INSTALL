SpikeStream 0.2 - Installation 

The prerequisites for SpikeStream 0.2 are largely the same as for SpikeStream 0.1 and the manual should be consulted for more information about setting up the databases, setting SPIKESTREAM_ROOT and the required libraries. The two main differences are that all of the build process is automated using qmake and SpikeStream 0.2 is built against Qt4.

Before building SpikeStream take a look through all of the .pro files to make sure that the locations of the third party libraries are correct (sorry, not automatic way of doing this at present). 

To build SpikeStream 0.2 use the following commands

cd $SPIKESTREAM_ROOT
qmake spikestream.pro
make

To run SpikeStream you need to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to $SPIKESTREAM_ROOT/lib. To run simulations spikestreamarchiver and spikestreamsimulator need to be in the PVM bin directory and in my installation I created symbolic links pointing to $SPIKESTREAM_ROOT/bin.

Support with the installation process is available at: http://spikestream.sourceforge.net/pages/support.html
