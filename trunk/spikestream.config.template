#LOGGING PARAMETERS
#Log file parameters
Max_log_size = 5000000

#Log level parameters: O disables logging; 1 enables medium logging; 2 enables full logging, which may incur performance penalties
log_level = 0

#FILE PARAMETERS
default_file_location = /home/davidg/spikestream

#NETWORK VIEWER PARAMETERS
#Controls the maximum size of connection group that will be automatically loaded.
max_autoload_conngrp_size = 1000000

#SIMULATION PARAMETERS
#How long the simulation waits for tasks to load their neuron data. You may need to increse this value for large networks. Value is in seconds.
max_neuron_data_load_time = 1000

#NUMBER OF DELAY VALUES
#Controls how many buffers are in the simulation and thus how many delay values are possible
#Each delay value is a single time step and so the amount of delay varies with the time step size in milliseconds
#FIXME THINK ABOUT WHETHER TO IMPLEMENT THIS OR NOT
number_of_delay_values = 250
