SpikeStream 0.2

The INSTALL document has instructions on how to install SpikeStream.

The FIXME document has a list of bugs.

The 0.1 version of the SpikeStream manual is still largely correct and can be obtained from: http://spikestream.sourceforge.net/doc/spikestream_manual-0.1.pdf

The 0.2 version of SpikeStream is under active development, so it is likely to freeze, crash and have other annoying behaviours! The documentation is also under development.

Support is available at: http://spikestream.sourceforge.net/pages/support.html
